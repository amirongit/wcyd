# WCYD
a desperate attempt to rebel

## what is
a decentralized messenger designed to bypass blockages which intentionally avoids having a single point of failure or downtime caused by censorship

## how does
four key concepts (network is the fourth, nerds)
- messages: encrypted or raw data in text or string format (the only supported data type) sent from a source peer to a target peer
- peers:  users with two pairs of asymmetrical keys (one for authentication & one for encryption) registered in a node
- nodes: instances of the software that manage messages & peers; nodes can connect to each other to form a network, authenticate peers (directly or indirectly), exchange data about themselves & their peers & act on behalf of other peers if necessary

## how to
the swagger client can be used for now; don't have a plan (& urge) to right a user interface

## when
these should be done in order to have an rc release (could be updated)
- integration tests
<!-- can you stop being a list, sir?! -->
these should be done in order to have an actual release (could be updated)
- have a security expert review the code & flows
